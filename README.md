# Data-Analysis-Using-KNN
Made predictions using KNN algorithum for 2 dataset in sklearn, one is the Breast Cancer dataset and second is the Wine dataset, described the step by step process of the implementations 
K-Nearest Neighbour Algo, uses supervisied learing that is it trains itself first based on the previous data provided and predicts output based on the existing data(trained data), this data needs to be clssified. The input(validation data) ploted on the graph along with the training data and output is predicted based on the attributed which match with the negibhours which are ploted on the graph. Now here the number of negibhours which can give precise data are to be decided, that is the value of 'k', therefore called the k-Nearest Neighbour Algo.

Python has multiple inbuild libraries which help in executing the complete end to end algorithum. Here we have used below libraries:

Numpy- This is used to do complex math operations. It also supports multi-dimensional arrays and matrices
Pandas- This is used for the complex array functions
sklearn- We are using sklearn to do get the dataset and apply knn algo, classify the data, and creating training data for algo to learn from it
matplotlib- This is used to plot grophs over the inputs and outputs received
KNeighborsClassifier- This is used to classigy the data,set the value of k and execute the algorithum
